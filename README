Riposte RPC Library
-------------------------

Riposte is an RPC library for binary data transmission over HTTP POST.  It can
share GWT services with any language that implements Object streaming from
Three Rings Design's Narya library.

Building
--------

The library is built using ant. It can be found here:

  http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/

Next, ensure that the necessary third party jar files are copied to the lib/
directory. See etc/libs-incl.xml for the list of those jar files.  To build the
actionscript library, copy etc/build.properties.dist to etc/build.properties
and specify the location of your flex install.

Finally invoke 'ant dist' to compile the code and generate jar and swc files.
Invoke 'ant -p' to see information on other build targets.

Riposte also provides .classpath and .project files for Eclipse users which
require that you set an EXT_LIBS_DIR variable indicating the location of the
external jar dependencies. The Riposte Eclipse project also depends on the
Eclipse project for the samskivert and narya librares.

Samskivert can be found at

and Narya can be found at
