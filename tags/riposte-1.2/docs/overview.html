    Riposte is a library for binary data transmission in RPC calls to a Java servlet.  It can share
    GWT services with any language that implements Object streaming from Three Rings Design's Narya
    library.  More info can be found on the
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ooo-riposte">Google Code page</a>.

    <p> I and others who have contributed to the library hope that you find it
      useful, easy to use and time saving. Comments and contributions are
      always welcome.
